# Liquid-Liquid phase separation in confined volumes, thermodynamics and dynamics

This repository hosts the notebooks and data used to analyse microfluidic data produced by the Arosio Lab (ETH) and produce the figures reported in:

- Droplet microfluidics for the label-free extraction of complete phase diagrams and kinetics of liquid-liquid phase separation in finite volumes Alessia Villois, Umberto Capasso Palmiero, Prerit Mathur, Gaia Perone, Timo Schneider, Lunna Li, Matteo Salvalaglio,Andrew deMello, Stavros Stavrakis, Paolo Arosio, 2022, Small 18 (46), 2202606
